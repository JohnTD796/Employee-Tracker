# Employee Tracker
  
  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to help refine sql skills and solidfy my understanding with how the relationship between routes and SQL queries should work by using inquirer. This was a great learning experience because it helped me further understand how to incorporate SQL with inquierer to display/add/update records within a database.
